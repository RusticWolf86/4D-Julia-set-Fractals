# 4D-Julia-set-Fractals
I made one of the fractals in Blender, 4D Julia Set. 
These are basically made by one complex equation "z = z^2 + c", where z are quaternions of complex numbers.
While creating this in blender, i just used single 2D sheet and the rest was it's coding to make a 4D Julia Fractal.
